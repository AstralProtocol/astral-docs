# Progress

### Weekly Updates

#### 27 April 2021

* Call with Ryan John King, CEO of FOAM space, a pioneer in the geospatial decentralized web. FOAM recently launched their [FOAM Lite Ethereum transaction relay device](https://twitter.com/foamspace/status/1336424195501285379?s=20), and is working on trustless "[presence claims](https://foam.space/location)".
* Reviewed the draft whitepaper for the Kolektivo Framework, a crypto-institutional framework that seeks to promote socio-ecological sustainability through cryptoeconomic mechanisms. Watch this space ...&#x20;
* Exploring ways to keep pushing forward with the Web3-native geospatial vision, which we first explored with a Filecoin development grant. More soon ...&#x20;

#### 13 April 2021

* Met with jabyl from [Distributed Town](https://distributed.town), where they're building a DAO for DAOs and a universal "skills wallet" enabling you to port your reputation with you in the mutual credit network .&#x20;
* Spencer and the [Commit Pool](https://commitpool.com) team joined the Astral Discord - really exciting work designing an app to help people hold themselves accountable. Set goals and stake money - by exercising claim your crypto back.  &#x20;
* On Discord we're discussing verifiable impact claims - a common problem that many teams are solving. One take: Impact NFTs.

#### 6 April 2021

* Submitted the GeoDID Explorer client application to Filecoin, completing our Development Grant. You can explore the Astral Studio - live on Ropsten - [here](https://studio.astral.global). Working on docs.
* Lots of community building this week:
  * Max from Earthify is building a data DAO that is crowdsourcing, standardizing, and publishing public / government records, with a focus on real estate data. We are advising Max and got to listen in to his design sprint with @RaidGuild.
  * Connected with David from KERNEL0x, started a conversation about privacy and data markets.
  * Another check-in with Grant and Pylyp from Copernic Space, building a Web3 marketplace for space assets including satellite imagery.&#x20;
  * One-to-one with community member @BlairVee talking through verifiable impact claims and community inclusion currencies.
* Drafted a concept note: [Impact NFTs](https://hackmd.io/@astral/B1Cl4YUBd), which represent impact claims made by people doing some environmental or social project. Reviewers would analyze evidence referenced by the NFT - threshold approvals could trigger bounty transfers to Impact NFT minters.

#### 23 March 2021

* Work week.

#### 16 March 2021

* Coming into the final weeks of our Filecoin development grant - developing IPLD-encoded GeoTIFFs, which will complement the GeoDID spec we designed. The idea is to use DIDs to create permanent, resolvable identities for satellite images. More soon.
*   We started outlining [v0.2 of the GeoDID spec](archive/geodids/geodids-v0.2.md) - a brief summary below.

    We want to build DIDs that support spatial querying and raster clipping, so a DID can represent a subset of a larger spatial dataset.&#x20;
* We met with[@KERNEL0x](https://twitter.com/KERNEL0x) 2 Fellow [@hollygrimm](https://twitter.com/hollygrimm), who is building [@0xDynamiculture](https://twitter.com/0xDynamiculture) - a DAO for Indigenous tribes to track their environmental projects using satellite imagery and sensor inputs We'll be looking at using GeoDIDs in their technical architecture![Satellite](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f6f0.svg)
* Advisory calls with[@MaxGlass](https://twitter.com/MaxGlass) - we'll be helping him design a spatial data crowdsourcing protocol with[@RaidGuild](https://twitter.com/RaidGuild)
* The community put together a response to a [post on ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch/t/how-to-implement-digital-community-currencies-with-ethereum/8801/8) on local + community tokens. Astral member [@BlairVee](https://twitter.com/BlairVee) is working with[@grassEcon](https://twitter.com/grassEcon) on this, and[@johnx25bd](https://twitter.com/johnx25bd) prototyped a location-aware smart contract wallet at ETHParis 2019.&#x20;

#### 11 March 2021

* Still building for our Filecoin Development Grant - working on IPLD-encoded GeoTIFFs and a front end GeoDID browser for Web3-native satellite imagery ...
* Working with a new community member building to collect land parcel data - watch this space
* Initial security reviews of Spatial.sol - much more to come.
* Architecting verifiable spatial data registries built on GeoDIDs and IPFS. Who do we know who would find a smart contract registry of geographic zones useful? Congestion zones - insurance protocols - local currencies - voting - what else??



#### 4 March 2021

* Initial tests for Spatial.sol. Point in Polygon is \*mostly\* working.
* Submitted initial implementation of the @astralprotocol Typescript modules for the Filecoin Development Grant. GeoDID client libraries and solidity contracts are functional.

* Discord member Econometrie raised some great points about how systems built on Astral could solve an interesting problem: how do we know where we can park rental e-bikes and e-scooters? We are working out how to adapt Hyperaware to help solve this.&#x20;
* A new member - Kiran - joined and shared a draft post he's writing about applying principles of token engineering to manage road network usage.&#x20;
* We have written a master document with overviews of the different tools and protocols we are building. This is open - feedback very welcome: [https://hackmd.io/0p7uwOijSMuFXcNE\_anDWA](https://hackmd.io/0p7uwOijSMuFXcNE\_anDWA)
