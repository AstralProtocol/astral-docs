* Discord member Econometrie raised some great points about how systems built on Astral could solve an interesting problem: how do we know where we can park rental e-bikes and e-scooters? We are working out how to adapt Hyperaware to help solve this. 
* A new member - Kiran - joined and shared a draft post he's writing about applying principles of token engineering to manage road network usage. 
* We have written a master document with overviews of the different tools and protocols we are building. This is open - feedback very welcome: [https://hackmd.io/0p7uwOijSMuFXcNE\_anDWA](https://hackmd.io/0p7uwOijSMuFXcNE_anDWA)
