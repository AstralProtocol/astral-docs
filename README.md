description: Astral - Building tools to enable the location-based decentralized web.

# Welcome

**Welcome to Astral!** 

Our vision is to build a protocol and community dedicated to creating an ecosystem of location-based Web3 applications and spatial contracts. We believe that the Web3 vision is incomplete without location services, and are working to develop technologies that will make it easy for devs to build user-controlled dApps leveraging location data.

We're taking a modular approach, architecting our tools so each component useful on its own, but all designed to work together. 

This Gitbook serves as the main hub for all Astral documentation:
