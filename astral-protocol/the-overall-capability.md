# The Overall Capability

In order to realize our vision of an ecosystem of location-based and spatial decentralized applications providing a more just and resilient means for human and machine coordination on Earth, we are designing the [**Astral  Protocol**](astral/) ****and building a corresponding stack of software tools. Our aim is to create a simple and delightful experience for the location-based dapp developer, enabling the community to drive innovation and build this ecosystem. 

The Astral Protocol provides the bindings between the spatial data domain and the Web3 universe. We intend to make no assumptions about the needs or use cases of developers building on Astral; instead, our effort is directed at creating a simple, versatile way of connecting both raster data and vector geometries, and relevant metadata, to smart contract and dApp front end interfaces. We believe that these spatial data primitives, along with the means to integrate them into smart contracts, will provide the soil from which the Web3 spatial ecosystem will sprout.

The components stitched together to enable this new spatial dApp ecosystem are:

* **Data capture** layer from a range of edge devices like satellites and IoT devices. 
* **Data storage** on distributed systems.
* **Data analytics**, including privacy-preserving techniques like compute-to-data and enclave computing. 
* An **oracle** system
* And our governance and spatial registry **smart contracts**

Astral is working on connecting these components using open, versatile tools.
