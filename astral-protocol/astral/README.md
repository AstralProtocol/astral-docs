# Astral Protocol

The Astral project encompasses the research and development of the ****[**GeoDID** ](../../geodids/geodid-intro/)specification and IPLD encoded geoTIFFs. It will also include the development of the **Astral Protocol**, which will implement the CRUD operations related to the GeoDID documents and the pre-processing of the GeoTIFFs.

The GeoDID specification will act as the default Web3 specification for working with geo-spatial data sets. Each DID Document will contain several assets endpoints and its respective metadata. The IPLD encoded GeoTIFFs will be implemented through an IPLD codec that will encode the GeoTIFF and enable GET Range requests, by a byte serving technique that will query the proper bytes through IPLD selectors.

**The desired result of this project is to bring geospatial capabilities to the Web3 ecosystem. By creating the necessary specifications and tools, we can enable the use of geospatial data and analysis within Web3, which, in turn, will create a new wave of decentralized applications and use cases of this kind of data.**
