# Spatial Contracts

Outline steps to create spatial contract capability. 

* Develop `Spatial.sol` Solidity library
  * Will likely include client JS library to convert common spatial data types \(GeoJSON\) into Solidity-compatible data \(i.e. float coords =&gt; int coords\)
* Prototype verifiable zone registries contracts and interfaces
