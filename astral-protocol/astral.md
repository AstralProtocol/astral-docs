# Astral Protocol

The Astral project encompasses the research and development of the ****[**GeoDID** ]()specification and IPLD encoded geoTIFFs. It will also include the development of the **Astral Protocol**, which will implement the CRUD operations related to the GeoDID documents, the pre-processing of the GeoTIFFs, the implementation of the Oracle system and the Spatial Contracts.

**The desired result of this project is to bring geospatial capabilities to the Web3 ecosystem. By creating the necessary specifications and tools, we can enable the use of geospatial data and analysis within Web3, which, in turn, will create a new wave of decentralized applications and use cases of this kind of data.**
