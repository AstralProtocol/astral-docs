# Introduction

Location is one of the fundamental properties of any physical object. Where something is, and where it is in relation to other objects, is an intrinsic attribute of its identity and determines many of its capabilities and responsibilities. What’s more - information about physical objects is carried on signals in the form of light, sounds, electrical currents, and so on. If some entity - organic or synthetic - receives these messages, they can perceive this information and learn about its origin.

Based on these phenomena, humanity has created an incredible network of connected sensors for communication and observation. Air and water quality monitors, thermometers, seismographic instruments, microphones, remote sensors - on, within or orbiting the planet - measure electromagnetic radiation, and others - these all capture empirical observations of the Earth every instant, forming a global surveillance system witnessing our shared, physical reality. This is happening constantly, in real time, and in a format that can be analyzed and interpreted by machines.

As these monitoring networks are developing, so is a parallel phenomenon. Consensus networks are creating a durable shared reality in the informational domain, controlled by no one and governed by a strict, transparent set of rules. Over a decade since Satoshi’s seed first sprouted, the Web3 universe is beginning to blossom. We believe that the fruit that will ripen will complement - and eventually, in some ways outcompete - our legacy systems and come to underpin the functioning of our global society.  


So naturally, we ask:

* What opportunities exist at the intersection of these technologies? 
* How could spatial data and Web3 technologies fit together? 
* How might we make use of this convergence, to serve us in our task of improving measures of human dignity, and our ability to act as stewards of the planet? 

As a response to our enquiry into these questions, we propose the **Astral Protocol**.
