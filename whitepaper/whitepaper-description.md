# Introduction

Spatial data contains information relevant to locations in the physical world. Different locations have different rules - depending on where you are you have to abide to a different regulatory framework.

To create decentralized applications that leverage spatial data and location information, we need to be able to store and access spatial data in ways that ensure it is simple and reliable for Web3 developers to work with.

The purpose of the Astral project is to create the bindings between Web3 and spatial data technologies.
{% endhint %}

The Astral project encompasses the research and development of the GeoDID specification and IPLD encoded geoTIFFs. It will also include the development of the Astral Protocol, which will implement the CRUD operations related to the GeoDID Documents and the pre-processing of the GeoTIFFs.

The GeoDID specification will act as the default web3 specification for working with geo-spatial data sets. Each DID Document will contain several assets endpoints and its respective metadata. The IPLD encoded GeoTIFFs will be implemented through an IPLD codec that will encode the GeoTIFF and enable GET Range requests, by a byte serving technique that will query the proper bytes through IPLD selectors.

**The desired result of this project is to bring geospatial capabilities to the web3 ecosystem, as it is a space that was originally built to be web2 native. By creating the necessary specifications and tools, we can enable the use of geospatial data and analysis within the web3 ecosystem, which, in turn, will create a new wave of decentralized applications and use cases of geospatial data in the web3 space.**

Our research and development efforts are showing that innovations at the convergence of these technologies will enable an ecosystem of new, durable tools and mechanisms to re-align human and organizational incentives towards agreed-upon social and environmental objectives.
