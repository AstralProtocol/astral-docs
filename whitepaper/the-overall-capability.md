# The Overall Capability

We are designing the [**Astral Protocol**](astral.md), which is a new way to represent spatial data on the decentralized web. 

The [**Astral Protocol**](astral.md) is the primitive that will stitch together various components which enable a whole new dApp ecosystem.

These components include

* **Data capture** layer from a range of edge devices like satellites and IoT devices. 
* **Data storage** on distributed systems.
* **Data analytics**, including privacy-preserving techniques like compute-to-data and enclave computing. 
* An **oracle** system
* And our governance and spatial registry **smart contracts**

Astral is working on connecting these components using open, versatile tools.
