# Spatial Data Registry

A Spatial Data Registry is a way of organizing and storing spatial data to run geospatial queries. This registry could be used across a variety of Web3 use cases: spatial governance systems, sustainability-linked bonds, parametric insurance policies, and location-based Web3 games. For MRV (measurement, reporting, and verification) applications, it's an essential tool for querying and identifying all data relevant to an asset, making it difficult, for example, to overstate carbon offsetting by concealing greenhouse gas emissions.

For a truly decentralized geospatial search, we have created the [On-chain Spatial Data Registry](on-chain-spatial-data-registry.md) where the geospatial index is stored on-chain.

We've also created a more performant version called the [Anchored Verifiable Spatial Data Registry](celo-evm-anchored-spatial-data-registry/) that makes use of MongoDB's spatial capabilities and validates the data by anchoring of hashes on-chain.
