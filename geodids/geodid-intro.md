description: A primer on geographic decentralized identifiers

# Intro

A GeoDID is a [decentralized identifier](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) for identifying _**spatial data assets**_ for use in Web3 applications.

GeoDIDs are:

> **✅ User-controlled.**  
> DIDs are independently created in a permissionless way: no centralized authority is required to approve or issue identifiers.
>
> **✅ Cryptographically-verifiable.**  
> DIDs are controlled using cryptographic keys. \(more detail here?\)
>
> **✅ Versatile and platform agnostic.**  
> GeoDIDs are designed to represent spatial data assets in as flexible a way as possible. This means they can be adapted to suit user requirements - important for enterprise and government adoption.
>
> **✅ Web3-native. \(?\)**  
> GeoDIDs are optimized to be decentralized. \(more detail and justification here\)
