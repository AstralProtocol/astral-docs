# Core specification

> We are early in developing the GeoDID spec. For now, we are focused on storing `geojson` vector spatial data structures, and `geotiff` raster data. The GeoDID specification is designed to be flexible and identify any spatial dataset in any format - even ones that haven't been developed yet.
