# Why are GeoDIDs necessary?

Spatial data is any data where the relative positions of observations are described by the data, and can be used as a dimension in the analysis. Put another way, spatial data has information about _where each individual datum is_ â€” and therefore, where the observations are in relation to each other.

A wide range of data formats have been developed to represent spatial data for a broad array of use cases and applications. Geographic decentralized identifiers act as a wrapper around these spatial data assets. This provides a common structure for referencing spatial data, and gives developers the option to bring these data assets into the Web3 fold, offering **independently verifiable cryptographic integrity guarantees**, the ability to store spatial data on **distributed file storage** systems like IPFS,  and, most importantly, giving the GeoDID controller full, **permissionless autonomy** over their spatial datasets through the use of public key cryptography. \(privacy?\)

\[@jared and @joao: is this a good justification for why GeoDIDs are necessary.\]

Our vision is to develop a set of tools for working with spatial data in smart contracts, oracles and other Web3 systems. These tools will be developed to natively consume spatial data identified by GeoDIDs.
