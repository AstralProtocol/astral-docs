# Spatial Contracts

With trustworthy spatial data assets stored on distributed, fault-tolerant systems controlled by the user, we are positioned to pull that information into smart contracts and use them in contract logic. We are intending to apply principles of composability to these contracts, enabling an ecosystem of interoperable Web3 location services much as the "money legos" are accelerating the pace of innovation in DeFi.

Working with spatial data in smart contracts has its social, technical and economic challenges. We are actively researching and experimenting to understand how these **spatial contracts** could be used to replace brittle and inefficient Web 2.0 systems, and what innovative new capabilities they might create.
