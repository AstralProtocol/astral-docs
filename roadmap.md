# Roadmap

We are building a lot of exciting technology and would love your help. We're open and would love to get you involved if you're keen - we're especially looking to speak if you are a Protocol Engineer \(or any engineer!\), a Product Design, a Mobile / Full Stack Developer, a Game Designer or a Community Manager.

**Things we are working on in the coming months:** 

* IPFS-native geospatial technology - bringing spatial data to the distributed web.
* Geographic Decentralized Identifiers as a key building block for geospatial Web3.
* Token engineering - thinking through mechanism design for a potential $ASTRAL token \(?\)
* Verifiable spatial data registries, enabling people to put zone borders on-chain - the first step to geofencing!
* Physical location proofs, so we can trustlessly verify that people or devices were at a particular place at a particular time.
* Gamified mobile dApps bringing Web3 out into the real world.
